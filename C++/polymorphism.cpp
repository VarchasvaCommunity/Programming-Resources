// The word polymorphism means having many forms. Typically, polymorphism occurs when there is a hierarchy of classes and they are related by inheritance.

// C++ polymorphism means that a call to a member function will cause a different function to be executed depending on the type of object that invokes the function.

// Consider the following example where a base class has been derived by other two classes −
